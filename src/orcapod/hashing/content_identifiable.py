class ContentIdentifiableBase:
    """
    Base class for content-identifiable objects.
    This class provides a way to define objects that can be uniquely identified
    based on their content rather than their identity in memory. Specifically, the identity of the
    object is determined by the structure returned by the `identity_structure` method.
    The hash of the object is computed based on the `identity_structure` using the provided `ObjectHasher`,
    which defaults to the one returned by `get_default_object_hasher`.
    Two content-identifiable objects are considered equal if their `identity_structure` returns the same value.
